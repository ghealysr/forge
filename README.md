# FORGE

![CI](https://github.com/ghealysr/forge/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

**Free Open-source Runtime for data enrichment.**
The open-source alternative to Apollo, ZoomInfo, and Clearbit.

---

## 5-Minute Quickstart

```bash
# Install
pip install forge-enrichment

# Enrich a CSV (zero config, works immediately)
forge enrich --file my_leads.csv --output enriched.csv

# Or start the dashboard
forge dashboard

# Or discover businesses by ZIP code
forge discover --zip 33602 --enrich --output tampa_businesses.csv
```

That's it. No API keys, no accounts, no credit cards. FORGE runs entirely on your machine.

## What It Does

FORGE enriches business databases at scale using free data sources and local AI. It extracts emails from websites, detects technology stacks, imports government records, and generates AI-powered business summaries -- all without paying a dime to data brokers. Point it at a PostgreSQL table of businesses and it fills in the blanks: emails, tech stacks, SSL status, site speed, industry classification, health scores, pain points, and more.

## Why We Built It

We got tired of paying $30K/year for business data enrichment that returned generic info@ emails. So we built our own engine using free government data sources, open-source AI, and 50+ technology detection patterns. Then we open-sourced it.

Tools like Apollo, ZoomInfo, and Clearbit charge $10K-50K/year for data that's largely scraped from the same public sources you could access yourself. FORGE does exactly that -- systematically, reliably, and for free.

## Features

### Email Extraction (6-Layer Pipeline)
- **Mailto link parsing** -- pulls email addresses from `mailto:` href attributes
- **Regex extraction** -- pattern-matches email addresses across page content
- **Cloudflare email decode** -- decodes Cloudflare's obfuscated `data-cfemail` attributes
- **JSON-LD extraction** -- parses structured data for contact information
- **Obfuscation decode** -- handles common email obfuscation techniques (AT/DOT replacements, HTML entity encoding, etc.)
- **Contact page crawl** -- follows /contact, /about, /team links to find emails buried deeper in the site

### SMTP Email Verification
- Generates candidate emails (info@, contact@, admin@, sales@, support@) from domain
- Verifies deliverability via SMTP `RCPT TO` without sending actual mail
- Respects rate limits and backs off on greylisting

### Technology Detection (30+ Technologies)
- **CMS**: WordPress, Shopify, Squarespace, Wix, Webflow, Drupal, Joomla, Ghost, HubSpot CMS, BigCommerce
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics (GA4/UA), Google Tag Manager, Facebook Pixel, Hotjar, Segment, Mixpanel, Heap
- **Frameworks**: React, Vue.js, Angular, Next.js, Nuxt.js, Svelte, jQuery, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS
- **Chat/Support**: Intercom, Zendesk, Drift, LiveChat, Crisp, Tidio, HubSpot Chat
- **Payments**: Stripe, Square, PayPal, Braintree
- **Email Marketing**: Mailchimp, Klaviyo, Constant Contact, SendGrid
- **Other**: Cloudflare, reCAPTCHA, Schema.org markup, ADA compliance tools

### Government Data Importers
- **FCC ULS** -- FCC Universal Licensing System (telecommunications license holders)
- **NPI Registry** -- National Provider Identifier database (healthcare providers)
- **SAM.gov** -- System for Award Management (government contractors, all businesses registered for federal work)

### AI Enrichment (Local, via Ollama/Gemma)
- Business summary generation from scraped website content
- Industry and sub-industry classification
- Health score computation (1-10 scale based on web presence signals)
- Pain point identification for sales targeting
- Runs entirely local -- no API costs, no data leaving your machine

### Quality Assurance
- **Claude Haiku audit agent** -- spot-checks AI-generated output, auto-pauses the pipeline if quality drops below threshold (requires PostgreSQL)
- **Field validation** -- type checking, format validation, and sanity checks before writes
- **COALESCE write pattern** -- never overwrites existing good data; only fills in NULL/empty fields
- **Rollback capability** -- tracks changes per-record for reversal if something goes wrong (requires PostgreSQL)

### Reliability
- **Checkpoint-based resume** -- crash-safe; restarts from last completed batch, not from scratch
- **Hourly self-monitoring** -- watchdog process detects stalls, OOM, or crashes and auto-restarts
- **Graceful degradation** -- if a single enrichment layer fails, the rest continue

## Government Data Sources

FORGE ships with importers for three free, public government databases:

### FCC Universal Licensing System (ULS)
The FCC publishes its entire licensing database as weekly bulk downloads. This includes every business holding an FCC license -- telecommunications companies, broadcasters, wireless carriers, satellite operators, and more. FORGE's importer parses the pipe-delimited dump files and matches records against your businesses table by name and address.

- **Source**: [FCC ULS Downloads](https://www.fcc.gov/uls/transactions/daily-weekly)
- **Coverage**: ~3 million active licenses
- **Cost**: Free

### NPI Registry
The National Plan and Provider Enumeration System (NPPES) maintains the NPI Registry -- a directory of every healthcare provider in the United States. FORGE queries the public API by state and matches providers to your business records.

- **Source**: [NPPES NPI Registry](https://npiregistry.cms.hhs.gov/)
- **Coverage**: ~7 million healthcare providers
- **Cost**: Free

### SAM.gov (System for Award Management)
Every business registered for federal contracts or grants appears in SAM.gov. The Entity Management API provides company details, NAICS codes, cage codes, and registration status. Requires a free API key from api.data.gov.

- **Source**: [SAM.gov Entity API](https://api.sam.gov/)
- **Coverage**: ~900K+ registered entities
- **Cost**: Free (API key required, no charge)

---

## How the Agent Loop Works

FORGE's `core/` module implements a lightweight agent loop designed for high-throughput data enrichment:

1. **Context Management** -- The agent maintains a sliding context window of the current batch (business records to enrich). It tracks which fields are populated, which are missing, and what enrichment has already been attempted.

2. **Tool Registry** -- Each enrichment capability (web scraper, email extractor, tech detector, AI summarizer) is registered as a tool. The agent loop selects which tools to invoke based on what data is missing for each record.

3. **Output Parsing** -- Raw tool outputs (HTML, JSON, SMTP responses) are parsed and normalized before writing. The parser handles malformed data, encoding issues, and edge cases.

4. **Orchestration** -- The pipeline processes records in configurable batches. Each batch goes through: fetch -> extract -> validate -> write -> checkpoint. Failed records are retried with exponential backoff before being marked as exhausted.

This is not an LLM-in-the-loop agent (except for the AI enrichment track). The "agent loop" is a deterministic pipeline with tool dispatch -- fast, predictable, and debuggable.

---

## Safety and Quality

### Audit Agent (requires PostgreSQL)
The optional Claude Haiku audit agent samples AI-generated output at configurable intervals (default: every 50 records). It evaluates summaries for accuracy, coherence, and hallucination. If quality drops below the threshold, the pipeline auto-pauses and alerts you. This is the only component that requires an API key -- everything else runs locally. Note: the audit agent requires a PostgreSQL backend; it is not available with SQLite.

### Field Validation
Every field write passes through validation: email format checks, URL normalization, score range enforcement (1-10), array deduplication for tech stacks, and type coercion. Invalid data is rejected, not written.

### COALESCE Write Pattern
FORGE never overwrites existing data. The write layer uses SQL COALESCE semantics: a field is only updated if the current value is NULL or empty. If you've manually corrected a record, FORGE won't clobber your work.

### Rollback (requires PostgreSQL)
Every enrichment batch logs the previous field values before writing. If a batch produces bad data, you can roll back to the pre-enrichment state for affected records. Note: rollback requires a PostgreSQL backend; it is not available with SQLite.

---

## Performance

- **Throughput**: 16,000+ records/hour with 4 parallel instances (web scraping track)
- **Scale**: Tested against databases with millions of records
- **Resource usage**: Moderate -- the bottleneck is network I/O (web scraping) and GPU/CPU (Ollama inference), not FORGE itself
- **Parallelism**: Configurable worker count; scales linearly up to network/database saturation
- **Resume**: Checkpoint-based; a crash at record 847,000 resumes at 847,000, not at 0

---

## MCP Integration

Add FORGE to your MCP config (`~/.claude.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "forge": {
      "command": "forge",
      "args": ["mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then ask your AI assistant:

- "Find restaurants in Tampa and get their emails"
- "How many businesses do we have in Florida?"
- "Export all healthcare providers with emails to a CSV"
- "Enrich this business: Smith Family Dental in Tampa, FL"

FORGE exposes five MCP tools:

| Tool | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `forge_discover` | Search for businesses by ZIP code using Overture Maps |
| `forge_enrich_record` | Add and enrich a single business record |
| `forge_stats` | Get database statistics (total records, emails found, etc.) |
| `forge_search` | Search your enriched database by name, state, industry |
| `forge_export` | Export filtered results to CSV |
